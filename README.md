# Data Structures Implementation in C++

## Overview
This repository contains my custom implementations of fundamental data structures in C++. All structures have been built from scratch without using the STL (Standard Template Library) implementations.

## Implemented Data Structures
- **Deque (`Deque.cpp`)** - A double-ended queue that allows insertion and deletion from both ends.
- **Forward List (`Forward-List.cpp`)** - A singly linked list with efficient insertions and deletions.
- **Universal List (`List-Universal.cpp`)** - A generic list that can be adapted for various use cases.
- **Queue (`Queue.cpp`)** - A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
- **Stack (`Stack.cpp`)** - A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.

## Features
- Implemented using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
- Efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- No usage of STL, ensuring a deep understanding of data structure mechanics.
